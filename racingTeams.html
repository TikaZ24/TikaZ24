<center><h1>Racing Teams</h1></center>
<hr>

<p> There are 10 racing teams in Formula 1. All 10 have two main drivers, reserve drivers, technicians, pit lane workers, managers, engineers, and designers. There are many people for each team. The team with the most <a href="pointSystem.html">points</a> wins the constructors championship, earning more money for the team. The <a href="pointSystem.html">points system</a> still works the same, but each of the two drivers' points are added up for the team score. </p>
